    <h3>Part 4: Global Illumination</h3>

    <h4>[Part 4] Walk Through on Implementation of the Indirect Lighting Function</h4>
    <p>
      To support indirect lighting function, I first implemented <b>DiffuseBSDF::sample_f</b> function to take a sample
      by a given outgoing light direction, and store the sampled incoming light direction to variable <b>wi</b> and its
      pdf to variable <b>pdf</b>. To do this, I first call <b>sampler.get_sample()</b> to get a sample, and then plug it
      in function <b>f</b> in Part 3 (along with the outgoing light direction <b>wo</b>) to get the bsdf, which is the
      return value. But before I return this value directly, I copy the sampled Vector3D to the input <b>wi</b> parameter,
      and copy the hardcoded <b>1 / PI</b> to the input <b>pdf</b> parameter, so that they will be propagated to the caller. At last,
      I return the calculated <b>bsdf</b> value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having <b>sample_f</b> function ready, I can start the implementation of <b>PathTracer::at_least_one_bounce_radiance</b>
      function. First of all, I check the depth of the incoming ray object: if it is equal to 0, that means we've reached
      the max ray depth, I just return <b>L_out</b> directly. This is the base case of this recursion function. If the
      ray depth is bigger than 0, we can continue the process. Firstly, I add <b>one_bounce_radiance(r, isect)</b> to
      <b>L_out</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, I take a sample using the outgoing light direction <b>w_out</b> by calling <b>sample_f</b> function we created.
      This will give us a incoming light direction <b>wi</b> and its pdf <b>pdf</b>. We will use this sampled incoming light
      direction to construct the shadow ray (the ray from the current hit point to the sampled direction). To do this,
      first I need to convert <b>wi</b> in the object coordinates to <b>wi_w</b> in the world coordinates by calling
      <b>auto wi_w = o2w * wi</b>; then I need to normalize this <b>wi_w</b> Vector3D by calling <b>wi_w.normalize()</b>;
      lastly, the new shadow ray will be <b>{ hit_p, wi_w }</b> (origin as hit_p, and direction as wi_w). I also need to
      set the <b>min_t</b> of this new ray to <b>EPS_F</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this new shadow ray in hand, I check whether there's any intersection with it in the scene by calling
      <b>bvh->intersect(next_r, &intersection)</b>. If the result is false, that means there's no intersection with this
      new shadow ray, I just return <b>L_out</b> directly. Otherwise, I continue the process with the new intersection
      value stored in <b>intersection</b> variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I need to use Russian Roulette algorithm to continue the recursion. Firstly, I created a new function
      <b>PathTracer::get_continuation_probability</b>, which will be used to calculate the continuation probability (cpdf)
      of the algorithm. It takes sampled <b>brdf</b> Vector3D variable, calculates the <b>norm2</b> value, and then
      calculates the percentile by <b>(3 - norm) / 3</b>, then return <b>0.3 + percentage * (0.4 - 0.3)</b>. Basically,
      this function will return a value between 0.3 and 0.4 proportional to the normal of the sampled brdf.
    </p>
