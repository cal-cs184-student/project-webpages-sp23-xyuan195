    <h4>[Part 1] New multibounce effects in each image</h4>
    <p>
      When max_ray_depth is 0, there is only light source in the rendered image.
    </p>
    <p>
      When max_ray_depth is 1, two spheres are rendered, but they are black. We can also see the reflection of the light
      source on the surface of the two spheres. The shadows of the two spheres are large and black.
    </p>
    <p>
      When max_ray_depth is 2, the ceiling is lighted up. And the mirror sphere can reflect the surrounding environment.
      And the shadows of the two spheres are smaller and fainter. But the glass sphere has a lot of dark spots.
    </p>
    <p>
      When max_ray_depth is 3, the most significant effect is that the glass sphere becomes "transparent". There is also
      a bright area inside the shadow of the glass sphere. But the reflected image of the glass sphere in the mirror
      sphere is dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      When max_ray_depth is 4, the reflected image of the glass sphere in the mirror sphere becomes transparent. And
      there is a bright area on the right (blue) wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      When max_ray_depth is 5, the shadows of the two spheres are fainter.
    </p>
    <p>
      When max_ray_depth is 100, the reflected light source on the surface of the glass sphere has more light areas.
    </p>

    <h4>[Part 1] Bounce numbers related to particular effects</h4>

    <p>
      The two spheres start to show up when max_ray_depth reaches 1. this is because they are not light source, we need
      at least one bounce of light to render them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reflection effect of the surrounding non-light-source objects starts show up when max_ray_depth reaches 2.
      This is because we need lights to bounce to the surface of the mirror sphere. So we need at least two bounces (one
      bounce from light to the object, and one bounce from the object to the mirror sphere).
    </p>
    <p>
      The glass sphere starts to show as "transparent" when max_ray_depth reaches 3. This is because this is the effect
      of refraction: we need light to bounce back from inside the transparent object.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light on the right (blue) wall starts to show up when max_ray_depth reaches 4. This is because the lights bounced
      from inside glass sphere need one more bounce to reach to the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we keep increasing the value of max_ray_depth, the shadows of the two spheres become fainter and fainter. This
      is because more lights get bounced into the shadow area.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, as we're increasing the value of max_ray_depth to a high value like 100, the area of the light source reflected
      on the glass sphere becomes bigger because more and more lights get bounced from inside the glass material to the
      surface.
    </p>

    <h3>Part 2: Microfacet Material</h3>

    <h4>[Part 2] Sequence of images of CBdragon_microfacet_au.dae with different alpha values</h4>
    <div class="ui info message">
      All below images are generated with sample rate per pixel as 256, and 4 light rays.

      <div class="header">Comments on the effect of parameter alpha</div>
      Parameter alpha controls the roughness of the material surface. The smaller the value of alpha is, the glossier
      the surface will be.

    <h4>[Part 2] Images of CBbunny_microfacet_cu.dae between hemisphere sampling and importance sampling</h4>
    <div class="ui info message">
      All below images are generated with sample rate per pixel as 64, and 1 light ray.
    </div>
    <div class="ui two column grid">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="column ui segment">
          <img src="./assets/part2_bunny_hemisphere.png">
          <h5 class="ui center aligned container">Hemisphere Sampling</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="column ui segment">
          <img src="./assets/part2_bunny_importance.png">
          <h5 class="ui center aligned container">Importance Sampling</h5>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="ui warning message">
      <div class="header">Comparison between two sampling approaches</div>
      The difference between cosine hemisphere sampling and importance sampling is that results of cosine hemisphere
      sampling are much noisier, especially on the service of the microfacet materials. The bunny in hemisphere sampling
      is also noticeably darker. All these indicate that importance sampling is more accurate and efficient for rendering
      microfacet materials.

    <h4>[Part 2] Image with another conductor material</h4>
    <p>
      I chose to use Zn (Zinc) as the conductor material to render <b>CBdragon_microfacet_au.dae</b>. The <b>eta</b>
      and <b>k</b> values are below:

    <table class="ui celled table">
      <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Parameter</th>
        <th>614 nm</th>
        <th>549 nm</th>
        <th>466 nm</th>
      </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>eta</td>
        <td>1.1181</td>
